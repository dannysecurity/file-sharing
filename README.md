This project is from UC Berkeley's CS 161 Course. In this project I designed and implemented a client application for a secure file sharing system.

This file sharing system can do the following:
  - Authenticate with a username and password;
  - Save files to the server;
  - Load saved files from the server;
  - Overwrite saved files on the server;
  - Append to saved files on the server;
  - Share saved files with other users; and
  - Revoke access to previously shared files.

More information can be found at https://sp24.cs161.org/proj2/overview/. All code past line 118 was written solely by me. The project has been consolidated into client.go.
